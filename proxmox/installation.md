# Proxmox Installation
Documenting my steps after first booting and installing Proxmox on my Slimbook One mini-pc.

## Install steps
Installing is actually very easy. I used the graphical installer.
1. Accept the licence blabla
2. Enter password and email adres
3. Setup the network interface. Be aware, you need a full domain name. For example: pve.homelab.local
