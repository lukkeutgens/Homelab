# Learning Environment &amp; Home Data Center
This repository documents the architecture and evolution of my homelab — a personal infrastructure designed for both learning and secure self-hosting.

I want to learn more about:
- Cyber Security: so creating a secure environment.
- Virtualization: Will probably use Proxmox for this.
- Linux servers: Will probably use Ubuntu-LTS as server (not decided yet)
- Containerization: Not sure what to use yet. I have already worked with Kubernetes, but that's overkill for this)
- ...

## Goals
I aim to deepen my understanding of:
- Linux Servers: Exploring Ubuntu Server LTS as a base OS (still evaluating)
- Cyber Security: Building a hardened, security-first environment.
- Virtualization: Likely using Proxmox to manage VMs and containers efficiently
- Containerization: Evaluating options like Podman, Docker, and LXC — Kubernetes is familiar but overkill for this scope
  
## What's next?
- Research for a good mini-pc to run it all on (cheaper then a server)
- Research the Ubuntu website, and see what can be done with it
- Learn about Proxmox
- Research architecture, what I need and how to setup it up.
