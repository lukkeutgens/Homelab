# Learning Environment &amp; Home Data Center
This repository documents the architecture and evolution of my homelab — a personal infrastructure designed for both learning and secure self-hosting.

After 20+ years working with Microsoft Windows as an OT engineer (PLC & SCADA programmer), it's time to explore the open-source ecosystem and try to build a modern, security-first environment using free and community-driven tools.

I want to learn more about:
- Cyber Security: so creating a secure environment.
- Virtualization: Will probably use Proxmox for this.
- Linux servers: Will probably use Ubuntu-LTS as server (not decided yet)
- Containerization: Not sure what to use yet. I have already worked with Kubernetes, but that's overkill for this)
- ...

## Goals
I'm using this homelab to deepen my understanding of:
- Linux Servers: Exploring Ubuntu Server LTS as a base OS (still evaluating)
- Cyber Security: Building a hardened, security-first environment.
- Virtualization: Likely using Proxmox to manage VMs and containers efficiently
- Containerization: Evaluating options like Podman, Docker, and LXC — Kubernetes is familiar but overkill for this scope
  
## What's next?
- Research a compact, energy-efficient mini-PC to host the lab (cheaper than a full server)
- Explore Ubuntu's tooling and long-term support options
- Learn Proxmox internals and best practices
- Design a modular architecture that balances isolation, efficiency, and security
