# Research Hardware
This document tracks potential hardware options for my homelab setup. Since the system will run 24/7, total wattage draw (TWD) and energy efficiency are important considerations. I'm primarily exploring refurbished mini-PCs that offer a good balance between performance, expandability, and power consumption.
