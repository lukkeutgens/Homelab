# Research Hardware
This document tracks potential hardware options for my homelab setup. Since the system will run 24/7, total wattage draw (TWD) and energy efficiency are important considerations. I'm primarily exploring refurbished mini-PCs that offer a good balance between performance, expandability, and power consumption.

## Notes
- The UM790 Pro is quieter and more power-efficient, ideal for low-noise environments and basic workloads.
- The MS-01 offers dual 10G SFP+ and PCIe expandability, making it better suited for future scaling or network-intensive tasks.
- Both units support NVMe SSDs, DDR5 RAM, and modern I/O, but the MS-01 has more aggressive performance tuning and higher idle power usage.
