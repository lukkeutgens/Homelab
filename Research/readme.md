# Hardware & Software Exploration
This folder contains my research notes, comparisons, and evaluations of hardware and software components for the homelab. 
It includes:
- Mini-PC and server options
- OS and distro benchmarks (e.g. Ubuntu LTS vs Debian)
- Container engines and orchestration tools
- Security tooling and architecture decisions

Used to document trade-offs, lessons learned, and rationale behind each choice.
