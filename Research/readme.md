# Hardware & Software Exploration
> ⚠️ This folder contains my research notes, comparisons, and evaluations of hardware and software components for the homelab.
> These are early notes that won’t be updated as the homelab evolves. They’re meant as a starting point to explore ideas and sketch out the initial architecture.

It includes:
- Mini-PC and server options
- OS and distro benchmarks (e.g. Ubuntu LTS vs Debian)
- Container engines and orchestration tools
- Security tooling and architecture decisions
