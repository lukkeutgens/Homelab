# Proxmox Learning
Some notes about Proxmox installing and setup

## Tips about settings
### Configure Updates
Setup the repositories correctly to get the newest (security) updates
- Enterprise repository is for a payed subscription (disabled it)
- Add the "No-Subscription" repository
- Ceph Quincy or Ceph Reef are for three node clusters (n.a. for me at this moment)
- Leave the debian repositories because Proxmox is built on Debian
